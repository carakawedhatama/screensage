## Project Background

This project was created as a fun project to facilitate the creation of tutorial videos for team training and documentation purposes. The need for a simple, yet effective screen recording tool that could capture both screen content and system audio led to the development of this application.

## Features

- üé• Screen recording with system audio capture
- üé§ Automatic fallback to microphone if system audio is unavailable
- üîä Support for Loopback audio device for high-quality system sound capture
- ‚èØÔ∏è Pause and resume recording functionality
- üíæ Download recordings in WebM format
- üé® Modern UI built with Tailwind CSS
- üîç Loopback audio device detection for better audio quality

## Audio Setup

Due to web browsers' security and privacy restrictions, the `getDisplayMedia()` API (used for screen recording) cannot directly capture system audio. To work around this limitation, we use [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) to create a virtual audio device that can capture and route system audio to our application.

For the best audio quality when recording system sound:

1. Install [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) (macOS) to create a virtual audio device
2. Set up a virtual device in Loopback to capture system audio
3. The application will automatically detect the Loopback device and use it for recording

Here's an example of a simple Loopback setup with a virtual device:

This ensures high-quality system audio capture without the need for additional configuration.
